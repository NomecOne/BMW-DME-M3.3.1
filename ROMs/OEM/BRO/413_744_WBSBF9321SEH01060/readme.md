Original car:05/94 e36 M3 Manual,coupe,s50,usa  
DME part number#:0261200413  
Motronic: M3.3.1 w/ EWS  ?
Chip #:1267358744 chip had official bmw label....????? Box had been opened when I got it.  
WBSBF9321SEH01060  

The BIN is oddball. Software is listed in the BIN as 506-965 but some of the surrounding info in the, I'll say, footer is not normal.  
Again this is dump from a original UV type chip with no visible label tapering.
